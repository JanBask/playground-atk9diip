SQL Azure is Microsoft's cloud database administration. In light of SQL Server database innovation and based on Microsoft's Windows Azure distributed computing stage, SQL Azure empowers associations to store social information in the cloud and rapidly scale the extent of their databases up or down as business needs change. 

Information is facilitated, overseen and provisioned in Microsoft server farms. Relocate your SQL Server databases without changing your applications. Sky blue SQL Database is the clever, completely overseen social cloud database administration that gives the broadest SQL Server motor similarity. Quicken application advancement and streamline upkeep utilizing the SQL apparatuses you want to utilize. Take advantage of the built-in intelligence that learns application examples and adjusts to boost execution, unwavering quality and information security. Today we shall see how to create a SQL Database on Azure. The blog covers the following topics-

## What are the Advantages of Creating a SQL Database on Azure?

### No physical administration. 
For individuals who are wary of managing the problem of setting up SQL Server, allotting databases and messing about with physical machines when all is said in done, having your database facilitated in such a way where the majority of that moves toward becoming another person's activity is a major in addition to. This is doubly so in case you're beginning new and don't have a current store of information to pipe up into the cloud someplace.

### High availability out of the box.
Azure, for the most part, blocks the requirement for structure high availability architectures. This applies to SQL Azure also; any databases worked inside it are naturally profoundly accessible.

### Scalable service plans for multiple needs and budgets. 
The modern quality highlights of SQL Azure may appear pointlessly excessive to people with moderately unobtrusive requirements, yet Microsoft has found a way to make SQL Azure be appealing to both the kinds of business clients. For one, they made a valuing structure that enables clients with littler should be suited; you can pay as meagre as $4.99 per database every month, with the most extreme stockpiling as of now set at 150 GB for each database.

### Elasticity. 
A much-mishandled popular expression, however in SQL Azure's case, it applies. Applications composed for various databases) can be scaled out with Azure by including occasions as required. All things considered, the best advantages of SQL Azure don't simply comprise of having the capacity to turn hubs up or down on interest. Microsoft additionally gives a framework of leagues to make scaling out less demanding and less effective, just as devices like the SQL Azure Federation Data Migration Wizard to additionally automate this procedure.

### Growing support for non-Microsoft technologies. 
The more third-party programming advancements Microsoft can bolster over all the distinctive layers of Azure, the almost certain individuals will utilize it to assemble applications with another programming they're as of now OK with. Besides Python, NoSQL, Java, node.js, and PHP being bolstered all through the Azure stack, one other major and critical tech that explicitly applies to SQL Azure is Hadoop. The Hadoop on Azure framework (Windows Azure HDInsight) is just accessible by the welcome at this moment, however, its unimportant nearness is huge. 

### How and Why To Create an SQL Database on Azure?
How would your advantage by making a SQL database on Microsoft Azure? For a certain one thing, moving databases among machines and cloud conditions turns out to be simple and quick. Also, you can deal with this without making changes to your applications, and keeping in mind that keeping up your on-premises framework flawless. Your application rationale additionally profits by having snappy access to concentrated information stockpiling, particularly when your application is relied upon to keep running on various machines and areas. Set up a SQL Database on Azure and you never again need to set up machines in topographically scattered areas. Simply store numerous databases as MS Azure Blobs and makes the neighborhood and virtual databases by executing Transact-SQL contents. Look at different advantages of making a SQL database on MS Azure:
•	Limitless capacity 
•	Lowered costs (because of decreased equipment overhead) 
•	High accessibility 
•	Quick, simple and solid fiasco recuperation 
•	Separation of capacity from processing brings upgraded security benefits 
•	Instant reinforcements and reestablishes for databases by means of the Azure Snapshot include

### Steps to Set Up a SQL Database On Azure Portal
In this instructional exercise, we'll be showing you how to:

#### Follow the given steps:
1.	Sign in to the Azure portal with your account subtleties (you can agree to accept a free preliminary account)
2.	To make another SQL database with Azure, click New à (Data + Storage) àSQL Database. As you set up a database, you can likewise make and set up the server that will have it, or utilize a current one. We'll set up another one.
3.	In the SQL Database settings window, under the Server àConfigure required settings option, design your database and server subtleties.

4.	Now, under Select source à Blank Database choice, select Sample. Give a name to your new database – we'll go to the Azure Database. Return to the SQL database window, where you'll see your new database's name under the Select sample
5.	Now open the Azure Starboard and snap Browse all to affirm that your new Azure Database is recorded on the web.

['Note: Your SQL database creation isn't finished until you design the settings for Collation, Resource gathering and Pricing level. It would be ideal if you check the Azure Resource Manager Overview to find out about designing Azure asset gatherings. Concerning Collation, allude to the Unicode Support for more data. You can scale the Pricing level here and there for your database whenever later.']

#### Steps to Configure Firewall Settings
You'll have to design firewall settings so as to associate with your new Azure Database from your customer PC. To do that follow the steps given here:
1.	From the Azure Starboard, choose the Browse All choices from the left-hand sheet
2.	Scroll down the choices you see on the right-hand sheet, and then choose SQL servers.
3.	Select the database server that you're utilizing for your venture
